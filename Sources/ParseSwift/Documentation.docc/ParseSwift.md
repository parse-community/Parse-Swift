# ``ParseSwift``
A pure Swift library that gives you access to the powerful Parse Server backend from your Swift applications.

## Overview
![Parse logo](parse-swift.png)
For more information about the Parse Platform and its features, see the public [documentation](https://docs.parseplatform.org). The ParseSwift SDK is not a port of the [Parse-SDK-iOS-OSX SDK](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-SDK-iOS-OSX) and though some of it may feel familiar, it is not backwards compatible and is designed using [protocol oriented programming (POP) and value types](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/protocol-oriented-programming-in-swift) instead of OOP and reference types. You can learn more about POP by watching [Protocol-Oriented Programming in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/) or [Protocol and Value Oriented Programming in UIKit Apps](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/419/) videos from previous WWDC's. For more details about ParseSwift, visit the [api documentation](https://netreconlab.github.io/Parse-Swift/release/documentation/parseswift/).

To learn how to use or experiment with ParseSwift, you can run and edit the [ParseSwift.playground](https://github.com/netreconlab/Parse-Swift/tree/main/ParseSwift.playground/Pages). You can use the parse-server in [this repo](https://github.com/netreconlab/parse-hipaa/tree/parse-swift) which has docker compose files (`docker-compose up` gives you a working server) configured to connect with the playground files, has [Parse Dashboard](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard), and can be used with MongoDB or PostgreSQL. You can also configure the Swift Playgrounds to work with your own Parse Server by editing the configuation in [Common.swift](https://github.com/netreconlab/Parse-Swift/blob/e9ba846c399257100b285d25d2bd055628b13b4b/ParseSwift.playground/Sources/Common.swift#L4-L19).

## Why use Parse-Swift from NetReconLab?
This repo is maintained by [Corey E. Baker](https://github.com/cbaker6), [1 of 2 of the original developers of Parse-Swift](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-Swift/graphs/contributors). Corey was responsible for the direction and development of all releases from [1.0.0](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-Swift/releases/tag/4.14.2) to [4.14.2](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-Swift/releases/tag/4.14.2). This repo will remain aligned with the original core principals of a swifty framework that contains zero dependencies and takes advantage of all of the features the [parse-server](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server) has to offer. The reason for the bifurcation from the parse-community version of Parse-Swift is due to interference and a number of disagreements with a member of [Parse Project Management Committee (PMC)](https://github.com/parse-community/Governance/blob/main/TEAM.md#project-management-committee-pmc) about the future of ParseSwift along with the PMC member ignoring code reviews and comments, marking relevant comments as `off-topic`, merging commits directly to main branch, lack-of-understanding of Swift fundamentals, client-side development, and lack of knowledge about how the Parse-Swift framework is designed. It is important to emphasize that no member of the Parse PMC participated in the design, release, and direction of Parse-Swift from its [first commit](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-Swift/tree/cf69b7f0638819a7070b82228bc51a97df5757e6) to version [4.14.2](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-Swift/releases/tag/4.14.2). In addition, no funding or support from the [parse-community funds](https://opencollective.com/parse-server) was ever offered to Corey for any of his [contributions to Parse](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aparse-community+author%3Acbaker6&type=issues), though a [number of payments have been offered and made to other contributors](https://opencollective.com/parse-server#category-BUDGET).
