 Objects that conform to the `ParseRole` protocol represent a Role on the Parse Server.
 `ParseRole`'s represent groupings of `ParseUser` objects for the purposes of
 granting permissions (e.g. specifying a `ParseACL` for a `ParseObject`).
 Roles are specified by their sets of child users and child roles,
 all of which are granted any permissions that the parent role has.
 Roles must have a name (which cannot be changed after creation of the role),
 and must specify a `ParseACL`.
