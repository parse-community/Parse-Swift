### 1.2.1
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-Swift/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1)

__Improvements__
- Child objects are now automatically saved in batches using transactions. This will result in less network overhead and prevent uneccessary clean up of data on the server if a child objects throws an error while saving ([#94](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-Swift/pull/94)), thanks to [Corey Baker](https://github.com/cbaker6).

__Fixes__
- There was a bug after a user first logs in anonymously and then becomes a real user as the server sends a new sessionToken when this occurs, but the SDK used the old sessionToken, resulting in an invalid sessionToken error ([#94](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-Swift/pull/94)), thanks to [Corey Baker](https://github.com/cbaker6).
